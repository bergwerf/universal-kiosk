Universal Kiosk
===============
This is a Chrome Kiosk App for displaying web content on Chromebooks while disabling
the possibility to do something else on your Chromebook at the same time. This app has
been initially built to take exams using Google Forms because it prevents students
from looking up answers online while making the test.

Setup
-----
1. Get Chrome management for each Chrome device.
2. Enroll each device in your schoolâ€™s domain.
3. Go to **Chrome Management > Device Settings > Kiosk Settings > Single App Kiosk**,
    select **Allow Single App Kiosk** for devices in the organizational unit you select.
4. Click **Manage Kiosk Applications**. In the dialog that appears select **Universal Kiosk**.
    You can search for it on the Chrome Web Store, or manually install it
	if you have the app ID and URL by selecting **Specify a Custom App**.
5. Make sure the devices you want to administer the exam with are under the
    organizational unit you select for the kiosk app.
